# Sylius EveryPay Plugin

[EveryPay](https://every-pay.com/) payment method for Sylius/Payum.
Uses [EveryPay version 4 API](https://support.every-pay.com/merchant-support/api/).

Currently only the one-off payment and the callback notification are implemented.
There is no support for any other payment scenarios. 

## TODO
- add tests
- implement missing actions
- split this package (Payum is used outside Sylius too) 

## NOTES
This is not an official integration. Authors of this package are not affiliated with EveryPay in any way.
